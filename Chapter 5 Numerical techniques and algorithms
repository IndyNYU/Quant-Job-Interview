Questions:

5.1 Write an algorithm to carry out numerical integration. How might you optimize the algorithm?

5.2 Suppose an asset takes values from a discrete set vj and the probability of vj is pj.
    Write an algorithm that produces the random variable for this asset from a uniformly distributed random variable.
    
5.3 Write a program to compute Fibonacci numbers.

5.4 Given 9999 of the first 10,000 numbers, 
    write a routine that is efficient in memory and computation time to find which number is missing.
    
5.5 Write an algorithm to increment the date by n days. (Robust against leap years and non-leap years.)

5.6 How can we efficiently exponentiate a matrix.

5.7 Code up a historgram maker.

5.8 Let f(x) = sin(x)/x. Write code that returns the value of f(x).

5.9 

5.10 Write an algorithm which, when given an array of random real numbers,
     finds the subarray whose sum of elements is maximal.

5.11 Suppose I claim I have a routine that can sort n nubmers in O(n) time. Prove me wrong.

5.12 Use the rand() function to randomly permute the integers between 1 and 100.

5.13 Write a routine to calculate n factorial.

5.14 You are given a matrix with the property that every row is increasing and every column is increasig.
     A number, x, is known to lie within the matrix, give an efficient algorithm to locate it.
     
5.15 A vector v of integers has N elements. Every element is in the range 0  to N-1.
     Write an algorithm that determines whether any number is  duplicated.

5.16 Write a routine to do linear interpolation.

5.17 A submarine starts at some point on the integer line; it moves a constant number of integers each turn.
     Once a turn you can lob a missile at some point on the integer line.
     Can you give an algorithm that will hit the submarine in a finite number of turns?

5.18 

5.19 Write a routine that sums the numbers in the nodes of a tree. 
     Nodes can have two branches, one, or none.
     
5.20 Given that a stock price at time T is N(100,1), you want to price a digital call struck at 110 by Monte Carlo Simulation.
     What will happen if you do this? Improve the method.
